# Dysarthric Speech Classification using Machine Learning Optimization Techniques

## Project Overview
This project addresses the classification of dysarthric speech patterns using advanced machine learning and neural network optimization techniques. Dysarthria is a speech disorder that affects motor speech control, making automated detection crucial for assistive technologies. The project compares traditional machine learning approaches with optimized neural networks to identify the most effective classification strategy. We utilize the TORGO dataset containing speech samples from both dysarthric speakers and healthy controls to develop robust classification models.

## Dataset
- **Source**: TORGO Database (University of Toronto)
- **Classes**: Binary classification (Dysarthric vs Control/Healthy speech)
- **Sample Size**: 50 files per class (100 total files)
- **Features**: Audio files processed into MFCC, spectral features, and spectrograms
- **Data Split**: 60% training, 20% validation, 20% testing
